# Shared transcripts

Share your AI conversations with teammates or the public. Shared transcripts let you collaborate on solutions, document debugging sessions, or showcase how you solved a problem.

## What are shared transcripts?

Shared transcripts are read-only copies of your Cursor chat conversations that you can share via a link. Recipients can view the entire conversation including:

- All messages between you and the AI
- Code snippets and suggestions
- Tool calls and their results
- Context that was included

This makes it easy to share solutions, get feedback on approaches, or document how a problem was solved.

## How to share a chat

### From Cursor

1. Open the chat you want to share
2. Click the **Share** icon in the chat header (link icon)
3. Choose a visibility option:
   - **Team**: Only your team members can view
   - **Public**: Anyone with the link can view
4. Click **Copy Link** to copy the share URL

The share link is created when you open the share modal.

### Visibility options

| Visibility | Who can view                       | URL format                                          |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **Team**   | Team members with dashboard access | `cursor.com/dashboard?tab=shared-chats&shareId=...` |
| **Public** | Anyone with the link               | `cursor.com/s/abc123`                               |

Team visibility requires the viewer to be signed in and a member of your team. Public links can be shared anywhere, including social media, documentation, or Stack Overflow.

## Viewing shared transcripts

### From a public link

Click a public share link (e.g., `cursor.com/s/abc123`) to view the conversation directly in your browser. No sign-in required.

### From the dashboard

1. Go to **cursor.com/dashboard**
2. Click the **Shared Transcripts** tab
3. Use the tabs to filter:
   - **Team Chats**: All transcripts shared by your team
   - **My Chats**: Transcripts you've shared

Click any transcript to view the full conversation.

### Fork a shared chat

Want to continue a conversation from a shared transcript? You can **fork** it:

1. Open the shared transcript
2. Click **Fork to Cursor** (or use **Open in Cursor**)
3. The conversation opens in Cursor, ready for you to continue

You can also use the deeplink `cursor://fork-shared-chat/{shareId}` (replace `{shareId}` with the share ID from the URL) to open and fork a shared chat directly in Cursor.

Forking creates a copy. The original shared transcript remains unchanged.

## Managing shared transcripts

### Change visibility

You can change visibility after sharing:

1. Go to **Shared Transcripts** in the dashboard
2. Find the transcript
3. Click the visibility dropdown
4. Select **Team** or **Public**

### Delete a shared transcript

1. Go to **Shared Transcripts** in the dashboard
2. Find the transcript
3. Click the **...** menu
4. Select **Delete**

Deleting a share removes the link permanently. Anyone with the old link will see an error.

### Who can delete?

- **Your transcripts**: You can always delete your own
- **Team transcripts**: Team admins can delete any team member's transcript

## Privacy and security

### What gets shared

When you share a transcript, the full conversation is included:

- Your messages to the AI
- AI responses
- Code snippets
- Tool results (file reads, search results, etc.)
- File context that was attached

### What's not shared

- Your identity (only first name shown if viewing from dashboard)
- Your authentication tokens or API keys
- Files from your local machine (only content included in the chat)

### Automatic secret redaction

Cursor scans shared transcripts and redacts potential secrets:

- API keys
- Passwords
- Tokens
- Connection strings

This helps prevent accidental exposure, but always review before sharing sensitive conversations.

### Storage

Shared transcripts are stored securely:

- Encrypted at rest
- Stored separately from your Cursor account
- Subject to your team's data retention policies

## Requirements

### Plan requirements

Shared transcripts are available for:

- **Pro** users
- **Teams** users
- **Enterprise** users

Free and trial users cannot create shared transcripts.

| Plan              | Available | Visibility options                     |
| ----------------- | --------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Free / Free trial | No        | —                                      |
| **Pro**           | Yes       | Public only                            |
| **Teams**         | Yes       | Team + Public                          |
| **Enterprise**    | Yes       | Team only (public disabled by default) |

Pro users without a team can only share publicly. Teams and Enterprise teams can use team visibility; team admins configure which options are allowed. Enterprise teams have public sharing disabled by default for security.

### Privacy mode

Users with **Privacy Mode** set to "No Storage" cannot create shared transcripts. The feature requires storing conversation data.

### Team admin settings

Team admins can control sharing for their organization:

- **Enable/Disable**: Turn sharing on or off for the team
- **Allowed Visibilities**: Choose which visibility options are available (Team only, Public only, or both)

Configure these in **Dashboard > Settings > Team Settings**.

## Troubleshooting

### Share feature is only available for Pro, Teams, and Enterprise users

Upgrade to a paid plan to access shared transcripts.

### Share feature requires data storage

You have Privacy Mode set to "No Storage". Adjust your privacy settings in **Settings > Privacy** to enable sharing.

### Shared conversations are disabled for your team

Your team admin has disabled sharing. Contact them to enable it.

### No visibility options are available

Your team admin hasn't enabled any visibility options. Contact them to configure sharing settings.

### The share link doesn't work

### You have reached the daily limit of shares

You can create up to 50 shared transcripts per day. The limit resets daily. Try again tomorrow.

## Tips for sharing

**Give it a good title.** The default title comes from your conversation, but you can customize it when sharing.

**Review before sharing publicly.** Make sure no sensitive information is included.

- Use team sharing for internal discussions to keep work-in-progress solutions visible only to your team
- Fork before modifying. If you want to continue a shared conversation, fork it to preserve the original
