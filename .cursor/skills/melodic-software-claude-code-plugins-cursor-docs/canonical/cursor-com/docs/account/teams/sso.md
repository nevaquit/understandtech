# SSO

## Overview

SAML 2.0 SSO is available at no additional cost on Teams and Enterprise plans. Use your existing identity provider (IdP) to authenticate team members without separate Cursor accounts.

## Prerequisites

- Cursor Team plan
- Admin access to your identity provider (e.g., Okta)
- Admin access to your Cursor organization

## Configuration Steps

### Sign in to your Cursor account

Navigate to [cursor.com/dashboard?tab=settings](https://www.cursor.com/dashboard?tab=settings) with an admin account.

### Locate the SSO configuration

Find the "Single Sign-On (SSO)" section and expand it.

### Begin the setup process

Click the "SSO Provider Connection settings" button to start SSO setup and follow the wizard.

### Configure your identity provider

In your identity provider (e.g., Okta):

- Create new SAML application
- Configure SAML settings using Cursor's information
- Set up Just-in-Time (JIT) provisioning

### Verify domain

Verify the domain of your users in Cursor by clicking the "Domain verification settings" button.

### Identity Provider Setup Guides

For provider-specific setup instructions:

### Identity Provider Guides

Setup instructions for Okta, Azure AD, Google Workspace, and more.

## Additional Settings

- Manage SSO enforcement through admin dashboard
- New users auto-enroll when signing in through SSO
- Handle user management through your identity provider

## Multiple domains

To handle multiple domains in your organization:

1. **Verify each domain separately** in Cursor through the domain verification settings
2. **Configure each domain** in your identity provider
3. Each domain needs to go through the verification process independently

## Troubleshooting

If issues occur:

- Verify domain is verified in Cursor
- Ensure SAML attributes are properly mapped
- Check SSO is enabled in admin dashboard
- Match first and last names between identity provider and Cursor
- Check provider-specific guides above
- Contact [hi@cursor.com](mailto:hi@cursor.com) if issues persist
