# Team Pricing

There are two teams plans: Teams ($40/user/mo) and Enterprise (Custom).

Team plans provide additional features like:

- Privacy Mode enforcement
- Admin Dashboard with usage stats (also accessible via [Admin API](https://cursor.com/docs/account/teams/admin-api.md))
- Centralized team billing
- SAML/OIDC SSO

We recommend Teams for any customer that is happy self-serving. We recommend [Enterprise](https://cursor.com/docs/enterprise.md) for customers that need priority support, pooled usage, invoicing, SCIM, or advanced security controls. [Contact sales](https://cursor.com/contact-sales) to get started.

## How pricing works

Teams pricing is usage-based. Each seat includes monthly usage, and you can continue using Cursor beyond that with on-demand usage.

### Included usage

Each team seat ($40/mo) comes with **$20/mo of included usage**. This usage:

- Is allocated per user (each user gets their own $20)
- Does not transfer between team members
- Resets at the start of each billing cycle
- Covers all agent requests at public list API prices + Cursor Token Fee

Our [Enterprise plan](https://cursor.com/docs/enterprise.md) offers pooled usage shared between all users in a team. [Get in touch](https://cursor.com/contact-sales) with our team to learn more.

### On-demand usage

On-demand usage allows you to continue using models after your included amount is consumed, billed in arrears.

When exceeding the $20 of included usage, team members automatically continue with **on-demand usage**:

- Billed monthly at the same rates (API prices + Cursor Token Fee)
- No interruption in service or quality
- Tracked per user in your admin dashboard (see [spending data API](https://cursor.com/docs/account/teams/admin-api.md#get-spending-data))
- Can be controlled with spending limits

On-demand usage is enabled by default for the Teams plan.

### Cursor Token Fee

All non-Auto agent requests include a **$0.25 per million tokens** fee. This covers:

- [Semantic search](https://cursor.com/docs/context/semantic-search.md)
- Custom model execution (Tab, Apply, etc.)
- Infrastructure and processing costs

This fee applies to all tokens: input, output, and cached tokens. This applies to [BYOK](https://cursor.com/docs/settings/api-keys.md) as well.

## Active seats

Cursor bills per active user, not pre-allocated seats. Add or remove users anytime and billing will adjust immediately.

Refunds appear as account credit on your next invoice. Your renewal date stays the same.

## Spending controls

Teams can configure monthly team-wide spending limits. You can manage these limits through the dashboard. Per-member spend limits are available on [Enterprise](https://cursor.com/docs/enterprise.md) plans.

Contact `enterprise@cursor.com` for volume discounts on larger teams.

## Model Pricing

All prices are per million tokens. Teams are charged at public list API prices + [Cursor Token Fee](https://cursor.com/docs/account/teams/pricing.md#cursor-token-fee).
